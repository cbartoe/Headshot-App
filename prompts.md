## Prompt 1
Create a spec.md for a professional headshot AI app where I can upload a photo, select from one of three styles (corporate classic, creative professional, executive portrait), and then get a professional headshot that I can directly compare to my original photo.

Include the requirements, tech stack, and 2 milestones. First milestone is to set up the UI and 2nd is to add Googleâ€™s nano banana image to image API: https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/image-generation. 

Use React for frontend and Express for backend.
