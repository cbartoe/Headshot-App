## Implementation Notes

### Using with Google Imagen API

When implementing these prompts with the Imagen API:

1. **Combine with source image:** Use the image-to-image generation mode
2. **Adjust strength parameter:** Start with 0.6-0.8 for good balance between preserving identity and applying style
3. **Negative prompts:** Consider adding negative prompts to avoid unwanted elements:
   - "distorted features, blurry, low quality, amateur, casual snapshots, multiple people, cropped face"

### Dynamic Prompt Construction

```javascript
const constructPrompt = (basePrompt, userImage) => {
  return `${basePrompt}

Maintain the person's facial features, identity, and likeness from the source image. Professional photography quality, 4K resolution, studio-grade result.`;
};
```

### API Parameters (Recommended)

```javascript
{
  prompt: "[Selected style prompt]",
  negativePrompt: "distorted, blurry, low quality, amateur, multiple people, cropped",
  strength: 0.7,
  guidance_scale: 7.5,
  num_inference_steps: 30,
  seed: Math.floor(Math.random() * 1000000)
}
```
